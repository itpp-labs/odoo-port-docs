   migrate-odoo-7-to-8

.. note:: Porting Modules is a process of adapting module to new version. E.g. we have module for odoo 10.0 and we want to make module work in odoo 11.0

          Word *porting* is sometimes replaced to *migration*. So, don't confuse it with `Data Migration <https://odoo-development.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maintenance/data-migration.html>`__.
